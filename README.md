# Local Transport Delay Prediction System

A hyper-local Python-based machine learning system to predict the probability of transport delays
using route, time, weather, and traffic density information.

The Urban or even the Rural residents frequently face unpredictable public transport delays due to traffic, weather, and other time-based factors. This project aims to predict the delays and its duration for local transport routes using historical and real-time attributes collected manually.

## Objectives
- Analyze factors contributing to transport delays
- Predict whether a route will be delayed
- Identify high-risk routes and peak hours
- Improve commuter planning and scheduling efficiency

## Sample Use Case
```bash
"A commuter checks whether Route 23 at 8:30 AM is likely to be delayed based on traffic and weather conditions."
```

## Why is this project strong?
- Uses original, local data
- Real-world relevance
- Scales from beginner to advanced
- trong ML + analytics balance
